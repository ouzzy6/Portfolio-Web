          I began my studies in digital pre-press, where I learned the fundamentals of layout design, preparing graphics for print, and ensuring quality in physical production. Moving from this technical field in graphic arts, I transitioned into a more creative role by studying graphic design, which refined my design skills and expanded my artistic vision.
          <br /><br />
          Over time, I worked in various fields unrelated to my studies, seeking a path that would complement my education. After reflecting on my interests, I realized that technology fascinated me deeply. With my design background, the opportunity to create and innovate in the tech world was incredibly exciting. This led me to undertake an intensive 6-7 month training program, where I explored both front-end and back-end development and worked on several projects.

          On a personal note, I’m also a musician. I play in an indie rock band and have a personal project where I explore sounds like gypsy jazz and French musette :)
